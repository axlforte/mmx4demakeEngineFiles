		["Scyther = voice acts zero. He also has been learning how to draw pixel art by helping out in this project, and has been a pretty good community member.",credits_demo_scyther],
		["Quantom x = voice actor and va locator. Once he joined the project voice acting went from unrealistic to dang near required. He voices magma dragoon and cyber peacock, and also does the ready stinger.",credits_demo_quantom],
		["Stacy berro - iris voice actor. Did a good job at avoiding a ‘damsel in distress’ type voice and made iris feel like a real character in the story.",credits_demo_berro],
		["Rex diamond = voice acts colonel. He’s a part of quantom’s crew and was very nice and polite going into the project.",credits_demo_rex],

		["Chris woodworth = slash beast and frost walrus voice actor. I feel really bad that the main reason he was brought on was because he had a british accent, but either way he makes slash beast and frost walrus really feel like seasoned military veterans.",credits_demo_woodworth],
		["hedgie = storm owl voice actor. His voice did a great job at making storm owl feel small yet formidable.",credits_demo_hedgie],

		["Mystic robert = split mushroom voice actor. He isnt in this demo unfortunately but you will be able to listen to his split mushroom lines later this year!",credits_demo_mystic_robert],
		["We also had some help from blue badea and yamato saito regarding art assets. The art was the biggest bottleneck for this project so them contributing their skills really helped make this project happen!",credits_demo_saito_and_badea],
